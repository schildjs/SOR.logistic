Description: This package conducts the sequential offsetted logistic regression
    analyses as described in Schildcrout and Rathouz (2010) for subject-level
    sampling and Schildcrout et al (2012) for observation-level sampling.  The
    auxiliary variable model is conducted with the known sampling probability
    ratio provided by the user and is included as an offset in an independence
    working covariance weighted GEE.  Estimates from this model are then used
    to identify the offset that is used in the target population logistic model
    that is estimated with covariance weighted GEE.  It is crucial to note that
    for time-varying covariates, working covariance weighting should NOT be
    used for observation level sampling due to violation of the no interference
    assumption described in Pepe and Anderson (1994) and Schildcrout and
    Heagerty (2005).
